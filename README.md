# 1] MNIST Number Prediction 🧠🔢 :
This project demonstrates a deep learning model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It uses **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of classifying digits from 0 to 9.

## 📌 Project Description
Handwritten digit recognition is one of the fundamental problems in machine learning. The MNIST dataset is a benchmark for evaluating image classification models. This mini project focuses on:
- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- Building a CNN architecture using Keras.
- Training the model and evaluating accuracy.
- Visualizing predictions and model performance.

# 2] # 🐾 Image Based Species Recognition (Cats vs Dogs)
This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project to classify whether an image is of a cat or a dog.`
## 🧠 Model Summary
- 2 Convolution + MaxPooling Layers
- Dense Layers
- Binary Classification (Cat / Dog)
## 📈 Training
The model is trained on a dataset of 2000+ images of cats and dogs.
## 🧪 Testing
Tested using a single image and evaluated with accuracy and confusion matrix.
## 📸 Sample Prediction
```python
prediction = 'cat' or 'dog'

# 1] MNIST Number Prediction 🧠🔢 :
This project demonstrates a deep learning model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset. It uses **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) capable of classifying digits from 0 to 9.

## 📌 Project Description
Handwritten digit recognition is one of the fundamental problems in machine learning. The MNIST dataset is a benchmark for evaluating image classification models. This mini project focuses on:
- Loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- Building a CNN architecture using Keras.
- Training the model and evaluating accuracy.
- Visualizing predictions and model performance.
